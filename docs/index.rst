Introduction
---------------------

`ifttt.com <https://ifttt.com/discover>`_ - If This Then That, also known as IFTTT (pronounced /Éªft/) -
is a free web-based service to create chains of simple conditional statements,
called applets. These applets can
perform a configured action in response to a trigger. Triggers and actions are web services provided by
platforms such as Facebook, Pinterest, Youtube, Spotify - and now, Plone sites.

Below are a few examples of IFTTT applets for better understanding:

 - If a video is liked on Youtube, then save the video details in Evernote
 - If a profile picture gets changed on Facebook, then update the same profile picture on Twitter
 - If I'm tagged in a photo on Facebook, then save it to my phone gallery
 - If I receive an email about a new Twitter follower in my Gmail inbox,
   then tweet the new follower a welcome message
 - If NASA posts a new astronomy picture of the day, then add it to my screensaver gallery.
 - Email me about Top Apps that have become FREE in the Apple App Store.
 - Automatically unmute my Android phone when I get back home.
 - Add a Spotify song from a liked YouTube Video.

**collective.ifttt** is an addon which enables any Plone site to play in the
IFTTT ecosystem by allowing you to create IFTTT applets.

Below are a few examples of using IFTTT with Plone sites.

 - If a news item is published, then tweet about it or post it on Facebook.
 - If an event is published, then add it to my calendar.
 - If new users sign up for an event, then add them to a Slack channel.
 - If content changes, then record who edited it in a Google spreadsheet.
