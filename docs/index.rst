`ifttt.com <https://ifttt.com/discover>`_ . If This Then That, also known as IFTTT (pronounced /Éªft/),
is a free web-based service to create chains of simple conditional statements,
called applets. These applets are responsible
to perform a configured action which got triggered by other web services such as
Plone Site, Facebook, Pinterest, Youtube, Spotify etc.

Below are a few use stories of IFTTT applets for better understanding:

 - If liked video on Youtube, then save the video details in Evernote
 - If profile picture gets changed on Facebook, then update same profile picture in Twitter
 - If tagged in a photo on Facebook, then save it your phone gallery
 - If receive a new email about a new Twitter follower in your Gmail inbox,
   then tweet the new follower a welcome message
 - Email me about Top Apps gone FREE in the Apple App Store.
 - If NASA post a new astronomy picture of the day, then add it to my screensaver gallery.
 - Automatically unmute your Android phone when you get back home.
 - Add Spotify song from liked YouTube Video.
