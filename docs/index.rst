Welcome to collective.ifttt!
============================================

collective.ifttt is a Plone addon which enables any
Plone site to play in the IFTTT (pronounced /ɪft/) ecosystem
by allowing you to create IFTTT applets at `ifttt.com <http://ifttt.com>`_.

Below are a few examples of using IFTTT with Plone sites.

 - If a news item is published, then tweet about it or post it on Facebook.
 - If an event is published, then add it to my calendar.
 - If new users sign up for an event, then add them to a Slack channel.
 - If content changes, then record who edited it in a Google spreadsheet.

This documentation will teach you how to use collective.ifttt to create IFTTT applets for Plone sites.
We'll start with setting up a Plone RSS feed, which can be used on IFTTT without doing anything special.
In the sections after that you will learn how to set up your IFTTT secret key and create IFTTT triggers,
so you can create more customized applets.
