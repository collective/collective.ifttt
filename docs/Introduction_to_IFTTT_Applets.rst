Introduction to IFTTT Applets
=============================

What is an Applet?
------------------

An IFTTT applet connects two or more apps or devices together.
It enables you to do something that those apps or devices couldn't do on their own.

IFTTT applets are composed of triggers (the "this" in "if this then that") and actions (the "that").
Triggers tell an applet to start and provide it with data, and actions are the end result of an applet run.
To use IFTTT applets, you'll need a `free IFTTT account <https://ifttt.com/join>`_.
Then you can connect your apps and devices with IFTTT.
