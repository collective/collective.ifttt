Introduction to IFTTT Applets
=============================

What is an Applet?
------------------

An Applet connects two or more apps or devices together.
It enables you to do something that those apps or devices couldn't do on their own.

Applets are composed of triggers and actions.
Triggers tell an Applet to start, and actions are the end result of an Applet run.
To use an Applet, you'll need a `free IFTTT account <https://ifttt.com/join?utm_medium=Help&utm_source=Applets&utm_campaign=Questions_About_Applets>`_.
Then you need to connect your apps and devices to IFTTT.
